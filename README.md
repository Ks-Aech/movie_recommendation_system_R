# Movie Recommendation System

This project implements a movie recommendation system using collaborative filtering in R.

## Overview

The system analyzes user ratings for movies and provides personalized movie recommendations based on user preferences and similarities between movies.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and exploration
- Visualization of movie ratings and user behaviors
- Implementation of Item-Based Collaborative Filtering (IBCF)
- Generation of personalized movie recommendations

## Dependencies

- recommenderlab
- ggplot2
- data.table
- reshape2

## Usage

1. Set the working directory to the project folder.
2. Ensure 'movies.csv' and 'ratings.csv' are in the working directory.
3. Run the R script to:
   - Load and preprocess the data
   - Explore the dataset
   - Build and train the recommendation model
   - Generate and evaluate recommendations

## Key Components

- Data loading and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis with visualizations
- Model training using IBCF
- Recommendation generation and evaluation

## Output

The system provides a list of top 10 movie recommendations for each user in the test set.

## Future Improvements

- Implement additional recommendation algorithms
- Enhance the user interface for easier interaction
- Incorporate more features like user demographics or movie metadata
